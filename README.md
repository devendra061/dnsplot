dnsplot
=======

Plot DNS traffic using gnuplot

Usage:
Make sure that both script files have execute permission
#chmod 700 dns_plot_script.gp
#chmod 700 dnstraffic_plotter.sh

dnstraffic_plotter.sh calls dns_plot_script.gp.
Thus, you only need to execute dnstraffic_plotter.sh script to get the plot


#./dnstraffic_plotter.sh

Above command will result in 'dnstraffic.png' image file
